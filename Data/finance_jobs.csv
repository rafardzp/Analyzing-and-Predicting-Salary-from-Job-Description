"Associate, Private Equity Clients (May Start Date)",Third Bridge,"Los Angeles, CA 90045","$84,000 por año",not specified,"Company Description

About Third Bridge
Third Bridge is a market-leading investment research firm. We provide integrated solutions for the world’s top investors and business leaders to help them make smarter and faster decisions. No other company in the world provides the same holistic investment offering: our superpower is the combination of human insights and unique investor-led content with a global expert network. We serve over 1,000 investment firms, offering clients 24/7 coverage through our team of 1,300+ employees located across eight offices.

Job Description

What is Private Equity (PE)?
In a nutshell, our private equity clients invest in companies with the intention of increasing the value of their stake down the line. The insights they get through our experts and content become the basis of their decision to invest in opportunities, or to pass on them.
Associate, Private Equity Clients
As an Associate you’ll have opportunities to work with the sharpest minds in private equity funds. They will rely on you for access to the most relevant experts and content, which you are responsible for identifying and recommending to them throughout their investment lifecycles. To do so you'll gather a unique set of commercial skills that will help you deliver extraordinary results for both clients and experts, and grow professionally. The projects can be complex, but the impact is meaningful - every day you will get to hear directly from your clients, experts and colleagues about the difference you have made.
The hats you will wear:
Salesperson: listen to your clients and tailor our offering in a way that best suits their unique needs. Use your negotiation and persuasion skills to create value for our specialists.
In practice: you will pitch our entire suite of products (content and expert calls) to investors in your book of business, and you will convince experts (from CEOs to technical experts) to speak to your clients about their industry.
Business developer: understand the drivers of profitable revenue and find your path to grow it. Work with your team to execute strategies for the accounts you are responsible for.
In practice: this could mean calling investors who have never used our services to build relationships and get business from them.
Problem solver: A client can challenge you with any company name and questions: you’ll break down an industry within minutes, suggest who they should speak with and what they should read.
In practice: you will search for relevant content and vet experts to support your clients at each stage of their research.You will not give them investment advice.
Learner: apply the knowledge and skills you acquire on the job to improve your productivity and find innovative ways to continue advancing our business model.
In practice: when a process gets in the way of your speed, you propose an alternate solution and speak with the right people to implement it.

Curious about our Consulting and Funds verticals? Check them out and decide which feels right for you. Focusing on an asset type allows our Associates to speak our clients’ language and intricately understand how they operate.

Qualifications

Areas that play to your strengths:
You must be able to deliver high quality work on a deadline. You will be working on lots of active workstreams simultaneously, but that doesn’t scare you - in fact it excites you, and you’re confident in your ability to multitask and remain organized. Private equity investors are under a lot of pressure to make decisions fast, but you stay calm and get things done. If at times your client asks you for help out of hours, or your expert is in a different time zone, you strive to support - your hours vary according to the client project you are involved in, but you prefer that to a routine job. There is no typical week as a Third Bridge Associate.
The Founder’s Mentality completely resonates with you, as this approach is part of our DNA. You’re an independent thinker who feels energized by the freedom Associates have to come up with the best solutions for their clients, because you’re endlessly curious and often question the way things are done. As long as you are eager to learn, we’ll provide you with the resources and coaching you need as you bring value to your clients and experts.
You’re a clear communicator who can create the right narrative to share your ideas with a wide range of people, such as introducing our products and services to new clients and experts. You find that conversations often lead to strong relationships with people because you easily connect. You always look for the most efficient way to get things done, rather than the path of least resistance - for example you pick up the phone to get an answer to your questions straight away, rather than send an email and wait for a reply. Cold calling doesn’t phase you - what matters to you is to get results, and fast.
Your attitude is to roll up your sleeves and you enjoy being in the thick of the action. It matters a great deal to you to understand how your performance ranks against your own potential and against others, so you continuously seek feedback to make sure you can be at the top of your game. One of your clients preferring a competitor over you is not an acceptable state of affairs for you - you’re relentless in getting the data points you need to adjust your approach until you are their number one. With the soft skills gained on the job (hard skills are getting displaced by machines), you aspire to a future as a high EQ business leader.

Additional Information

What our people love about being Associates in PE:
Being surrounded by people they not only enjoy working with, but who also challenge and support them
Partnering first hand with the leading investors in the world and being privy to their thought process with all the learning this leads to
Building their career in business on a foundation of problem-solving, communication and commercial skills

Salesperson: listen to your clients and tailor our offering in a way that best suits their unique needs. Use your negotiation and persuasion skills to create value for our specialists.
In practice: you will pitch our entire suite of products (content and expert calls) to investors in your book of business, and you will convince experts (from CEOs to technical experts) to speak to your clients about their industry.
Business developer: understand the drivers of profitable revenue and find your path to grow it. Work with your team to execute strategies for the accounts you are responsible for.
In practice: this could mean calling investors who have never used our services to build relationships and get business from them.
Problem solver: A client can challenge you with any company name and questions: you’ll break down an industry within minutes, suggest who they should speak with and what they should read.
In practice: you will search for relevant content and vet experts to support your clients at each stage of their research.You will not give them investment advice.
Learner: apply the knowledge and skills you acquire on the job to improve your productivity and find innovative ways to continue advancing our business model.
In practice: when a process gets in the way of your speed, you propose an alternate solution and speak with the right people to implement it.

Qualifications

Areas that play to your strengths:
You must be able to deliver high quality work on a deadline. You will be working on lots of active workstreams simultaneously, but that doesn’t scare you - in fact it excites you, and you’re confident in your ability to multitask and remain organized. Private equity investors are under a lot of pressure to make decisions fast, but you stay calm and get things done. If at times your client asks you for help out of hours, or your expert is in a different time zone, you strive to support - your hours vary according to the client project you are involved in, but you prefer that to a routine job. There is no typical week as a Third Bridge Associate.
The Founder’s Mentality completely resonates with you, as this approach is part of our DNA. You’re an independent thinker who feels energized by the freedom Associates have to come up with the best solutions for their clients, because you’re endlessly curious and often question the way things are done. As long as you are eager to learn, we’ll provide you with the resources and coaching you need as you bring value to your clients and experts.
You’re a clear communicator who can create the right narrative to share your ideas with a wide range of people, such as introducing our products and services to new clients and experts. You find that conversations often lead to strong relationships with people because you easily connect. You always look for the most efficient way to get things done, rather than the path of least resistance - for example you pick up the phone to get an answer to your questions straight away, rather than send an email and wait for a reply. Cold calling doesn’t phase you - what matters to you is to get results, and fast.
Your attitude is to roll up your sleeves and you enjoy being in the thick of the action. It matters a great deal to you to understand how your performance ranks against your own potential and against others, so you continuously seek feedback to make sure you can be at the top of your game. One of your clients preferring a competitor over you is not an acceptable state of affairs for you - you’re relentless in getting the data points you need to adjust your approach until you are their number one. With the soft skills gained on the job (hard skills are getting displaced by machines), you aspire to a future as a high EQ business leader.
