#1 Objective: Meet or Exceed Client Spend and ROAS or CPA Targets
Why Are We Hiring this Now?
Hello, my name is Cathy Benton, Chief Revenue Officer at TNT, and I need your help. Over the last few years, I've been scaling our agency and driving our clients' success by recruiting incredible talent into our team. The impact of these collective efforts has paid off. Our agency's reputation for consistently delivering results has reached the point where we now have a 6-month waiting list for new clients eager to partner with us. And that’s where you come in.
To hit the next chapter of success requires that we recruit the next wave of exceptional talent into our family, and I'm genuinely excited about the prospect of you being part of it. The performance manager plays a mission-critical role – they are THE quarterback for our team, ensuring that strategy, media, creative, CRO, LTV and everything in between is optimized for each client that is part of their portfolio. The buck stops with you in this role – and that should be energizing!
What’s the Ideal Candidate’s Background?
The ideal candidate is naturally comfortable leading a team and being the central point of contact for the client externally… while being a strong advocate for the client internally. You’re a gifted marketer and optimizer and thoroughly enjoy scrutinizing every step in the client's funnel to pinpoint bottlenecks and spot opportunities to boost CTR, ROAS, CVR, AOV, LTV and other key funnel metrics that open the door to additional, profitable scale.
This requires you be extremely comfortable analyzing research, audiences, campaigns, video ads, VSLs, offers, upsells and everything in between. It requires the ability to both think creatively about positioning, pain points, hooks, value props, etc., as well as quantitatively to be able to dive deep into data to detect patterns, gain insights, formulate hypotheses, and get them implemented.
Most importantly, however, you are addicted to winning and driving growth. You get uncomfortable if things aren’t running smoothly, annoyed when hypotheses don’t turn out how you thought (diving deep to figure out why), and pissed if you’re at risk for missing your targets. You love taking on the challenge of being given a target by the client and the autonomy by your company to figure out how to make it all work. And you gain immense satisfaction working with your team to smash through those targets and deliver success.
What’s It Like Working at TNT?
I’ve gone to great lengths to set up a culture that supports rapid learning and success for performance marketers. Moreover, we’re extremely heavily focused on collaboration and teamwork to ensure we have proper coverage across all our clients.
For example, we’ve structured our teams into cells, each of which has a portfolio of clients its assigned. Each cell is comprised of a performance manager (you), a media buyer, creative producer, junior and senior copywriters, and video editors. Everyone on the cell marches to the beat of the same drum, focused on the single goal of hitting client spend and ROAS targets.
Regardless of what cell you’re in, everyone benefits from the following:
Sophisticated Analytics – In addition to detailed campaign reporting, we have a proprietary analytics platform that allows us to pinpoint which elements of video ads drive response
Shared Learnings – Participation in weekly “best of” calls where in all performance marketers share what’s working across the board both for client ads and funnels
Clear Feedback / Mentoring – You’ll be given clear feedback on your performance and routine mentoring sessions to ensure you continually upskill and develop your craft
Subject Variety – You’ll be given a huge variety of subject matter to work on, with a mix of clients who have a mix of offers in your assigned cell, rotating to other cells over time
High-Caliber, Collaborative Team – You’ll have the full resources you need to win, with everything from analytics to copywriting, video editing, media buying, etc.
What Outcomes Will You Be Responsible for?
Performance and Growth of a Portfolio of Clients – You’ll have an opportunity to build a portfolio of a handful of clients who spend $2M - $5M per month. Campaigns will primarily run on Meta and Google. Your #1 goal is to increase the effectiveness of the client’s campaign to ensure the client achieves their primary KPIs and scale the account.
Cultivate Strong Client Relationships – Because you’ll be the primary point of contact with the client, you’ll need to cultivate a strong, respectful, trusting relationship that encourages the bilateral sharing of information and fast resolution of issues. The client will expect you to be “on it” – and so will we.
Drive Campaign Performance Daily – Every day you will stay on top of campaign and ad-level performance metrics providing data–driven insight and opportunities for the media and creative team to expand and scale ad concepts and campaigns.
Optimize Conversion Funnel KPIs – You’ll invest significant time analyzing the entire funnel, formulating hypothesis and running testing to improve CVR, AOV, LTV and other relevant funnel KPIs to drive improved ROAS.
Drive Creative Expansion – With your knowledge of the client’s product and customer base, you will play a pivotal role in helping the creative team expand existing controls through variation expansions and VSL expansions. Each week you will work directly with the media and creative team to suggest tests to scale the account.
Extend Campaign Success – By looking daily at campaign data, you’ll provide the insight needed to expand campaigns and prevent them from fizzling out. This could be by working with the creative team to test completely new concepts, with the media team to target new audiences, or coming up with your own CRO funnel tests to boost CVR, AOV or LTV to provide more buffer for the existing campaigns to run longer.
How Will Your Time Be Spent?
While any given week can vary based on client demands, here’s roughly how it shakes out:
30% creative optimization, scaling decisions and performing market research
20% analyzing results to identifying key trends to capitalize on or protect against
20% managing and cultivating client relationships
20% delivering/managing projects and performing leadership activities
10% funnel optimization to maximize AOV and CVR
Requirements
3-5+ Years Performance Marketing Experience – Ideally at an agency or a company with multiple brands wherein you were directly accountable for delivering ad spend and ROAS targets and had to work with a team in a fast-paced environment to do so
Problem Solver – You’re naturally gifted at solving problems, whether that’s by removing a bottleneck, capitalizing on an opportunity, using new tech, optimizing processes, organizing assets differently or completely re-formulating audience/offer/positioning strategy
Data-Driven – You have a love for numbers, can easily build, manipulate and slice and dice spreadsheets, detecting patterns that lead to the insights that inform next steps
Creative Marketer – You’re an extremely creative marketer, with the ability to look at things through multiple dimensions to pinpoint ways to crack the code to get a client offer to scale
Team Leader – You excel at leading a team, getting them aligned on a target, devising an action plan to hit that target and methodically executing along the way, pivoting as needed
Ownership Mindset – You take extreme pride in submitting high-quality work that’s on time, on spec, been double checked, meets all compliance guidelines, etc.
Exceptional Communicator – A perceptive listener who quickly synthesize info and can formulate a methodical action plan that can be clearly articulated verbally and in writing"

We connect with major hospitals, payors, and suppliers of life-saving products.

About Parachute
Parachute Health is the industry leading ePrescribing Platform for durable medical equipment (DME) and supplies - think everything from state of the art glucose monitors to walkers.

The ordering process is convoluted and fax-based, leading to high cost of care, clinician dissatisfaction and poor patient outcomes. While the drug industry adopted ePrescribing long ago, the transition to digital is only now underway for DME, and Parachute Health is leading this transition.
