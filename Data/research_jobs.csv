Research Coordinator for NIH Minority Health Grant,Dance4Healing,Remote,"Hasta $50,000 por año",Contract,"Dance4Healing, a Singularity University/Stanford startup, is seeking a Research Coordinator for our National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) study. Apply at https://bit.ly/D4H_NIHStudy_Talent if interested.
Dance4Healing (D4H) is an award-winning social venture founded by a UX and behavior expert months after recovering from Stage IV cancer. D4H’s Stanford Cancer Supportive Care Program achieved a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 91 from 90+ patients; most reported significant improvement in anxiety, depression, pain, and energy levels.
Guided by The NIMHD Research Framework, this research will study the effects of intersectional identities on racial/ethnic equity, reduce Artificial Intelligence (AI) bias, and develop a culturally sensitive novel habit-building algorithm for minority Diabetes Mellitus (DM) patients using Creative Arts Therapy (CAT: Music, Dance, Arts) for remote activity engagement systems with multilevel data tracking and effective behavior prompts. We will partner with Stanford, Institute on Aging, Koelsch Communities, Generation United, and Heritage On The Marina to develop a groundbreaking smart platform integrating biosensors and a Telehealth Live Video Platform (TLVP). This project aims to gather insights into different domains (Biological, Behavioral, Physical/Built Environment, Sociocultural Environment, Healthcare System) and levels (Individual, Interpersonal, Community, Societal) that influence healthy habits, then analyze the data to adapt D4H to improve patients’ mobility and social connections. D4H’s proprietary personalization will tailor to users’ needs/desires and pair them with compatible buddies to build lasting habits with recorded and live video classes (think YouTube + Zoom + eHarmony for health buddies).
You will work with a multidisciplinary team of experts in health disparity, diabetes, cardiovascular health, biotracking, behavioral sciences, dance therapy, and data/AI science.
A Research Coordinator (RC) manages and conducts the day-to-day activities of a research study. The Principal Investigator (PI) determines the RC’s specific responsibilities and works closely with the RC. An RC usually has a bachelor’s degree in a scientific, health-related, or business administration program.
RC Role:
Ensures the study maintains accordance with the protocol, applicable regulations, and Institutional Review Board (IRB) requirements.
Day-to-day administrative duties.
Act as a liaison for the research site.
Ensure staff are properly trained per the protocol.
Recruit and/or register participants.
Maintain study guidelines.
Collect and/or review the data or review before it is entered into a study database.
Why this study: 34.2 M Americans with DM cost $327 B in 2018. 68% of them will die from cardiovascular disease. CDC reported that DM disproportionately affects minorities. Partnering with Stanford professors Dr. Palaniappan and Dr. Haddad, who have pioneered research on health disparities and exercise/dance intervention for DM patients, this innovation will expand the research field and have a broader impact on minority health. Currently, there is a lack of data on effective lifestyle recommendations for normal-weight diabetics (NWD), accounting for 1 in 5 Type II DM patients. NWD is especially prevalent in Asian populations and the elderly, facing higher mortality rates than obese diabetics. Research shows dance improves DM and reduces cardiovascular deaths by 46%. These interventions, however, are only available in person. There are many exercise programs and live video tools, but they rarely cater to an individual’s mobility and accessibility needs. Hence, there is an unmet need for an easy-to-adopt telehealth platform enticing patients to dance from home.
AI Bias: Integrating AI into clinical practice requires addressing biases. Three types of bias can be identified in healthcare: data-driven, algorithmic, and human. AI algorithms that propagate deeply-rooted societal bias can have catastrophic impacts. Consequently, some patient groups, such as ethnic and gender minorities underrepresented in existing datasets, can be misdiagnosed, further amplifying inequalities. Every step of the algorithm development process can be influenced by bias. It begins when designing the study and collecting data, continues with data entry, cleaning, and algorithm design, and ends with implementing the models and disseminating the results.
Impact and Next Step: This study will establish clear metrics of health equity success; outcomes will be publicized (papers/conferences) to incentivize action and influence policymakers. It will lay the groundwork for a multicenter trial with American Heart Association to integrate more biosensors, voice user interfaces, and culture-sensitive AI to further increase adoption and engagement and reduce health disparities.

Research Fellow,The Good Food Institute,Remote,$30 por hora,Part-time,"**Only candidates based in the United States are eligible to apply**
Determine the feasibility and potential impact of lactate valorization in cultivated meat manufacturing
The Good Food Institute (GFI) is a nonprofit think tank working to make the global food system better for the planet, people, and animals. Alongside scientists, businesses, and policymakers, GFI's teams focus on making plant-based, fermentation-derived, and cultivated meat delicious, affordable, and accessible. Powered by philanthropy, GFI is an international network of organizations advancing alternative proteins as an essential solution needed to meet the world's climate, global health, food security, and biodiversity goals.
How You Will Make a Difference
In this role, you will have the opportunity to apply your scientific background to assess the tractability of lactate recovery during cultivated meat production. This research will be crucial in informing potential ways to reduce the environmental impact and create potential new revenue streams for future, scaled cultivated meat manufacturing. The Research Fellow will be responsible for:
Conducting a literature review of the current state of the art for capturing lactate out of solution with a focus on the percentage of recovery that is achievable and the costs of different methods.
Conducting interviews with cultivated meat companies that are willing to share information or data on lactate production and recovery methods.
Assembling estimates for lactate production as a metabolic byproduct during cultivated meat manufacturing based on primary literature data theoretical models, and data from cultivated meat companies.
Creating a model, based on rates of lactate production and recovery, that estimates the amount of lactate that could be recovered from a cultivated meat production process at scale.
Using the model to answer questions such as, how much lactate is expected to be produced during cultivated meat production? How much of the carbon footprint of cultivated meat production could be offset if lactate was captured and allocated as a co-product during production? Could the sales of captured lactate as a co-product (e.g., into poly-lactic acid production) outweigh the costs, enabling additional revenue streams for cultivated meat manufacturers?
Answering additional questions such as, what are the impacts of different allocation methods for lactate? Could this be done today, or is further optimization needed? What research gaps or other limitations exist in making lactate valorization feasible? What solutions would you propose to alleviate those limitations?
Assembling the figures and findings from the research and modeling in a manuscript to be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal focused on environmental impact or special issues related to cultivated meat.
Communicating the findings to a broader audience in a co-authored blog post.
Who We're Looking For
The Research Fellow must have:
Ph.D. preferred; candidates currently pursuing a Ph.D. or candidates with a B.S. or M.Sc. with an additional 2-4+ years of relevant experience can also apply.
Strong scientific writing skills.
Ability to perform independent, self-paced work.
Coursework or other experience with life cycle assessment methodology, including allocation.
A strong understanding of cultivated meat manufacturing processes and familiarity with life cycle and techno-economic studies that have been published.
A commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion.
Strong support for GFI's philosophy and mission; demonstrated interest in plant-based & other alt proteins, public health, environmentalism, climate change, animal protection, or hunger relief.
A commitment to GFI's values: believe change is possible, do the most good we can, share knowledge freely, act on evidence, and invite everyone to the table.
We want the best people and we don't want biases holding us back. We use a third-party anonymizing tool to redact personal information from submitted applications — including name, location, contact details, and several other factors — to reduce bias and increase fairness in our process. We strongly encourage people of every race, color, orientation, age, gender, origin, and ability to apply. Since we value a diverse workplace, we prioritize an inclusive climate absent of discrimination and harassment during the application process and after you join the team.
Research indicates that men tend to apply for jobs when they meet just 60% of the criteria, while women and people from other marginalized groups only apply if they are a 100% match. If you are passionate about GFI's mission and think you have what it takes to be successful in this role even if you don't check all the boxes, please apply. We'd appreciate the opportunity to consider your application.

Full Time 40 hours Grade 055 Pathology & Lab Medicine M&D
Responsibilities
POSITION
A postdoctoral position at the University of Rochester Medical Center in Dr. Brendan Boyce's Laboratory.
GENERAL SUMMARY
A postdoctoral position is available immediately in the laboratory of Dr. Boyce, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and the Center for Musculoskeletal Research at the University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, following the successful renewal of an NIH RO-1 grant that has been funded continuously since 1995. Dr. Boyce is a surgical pathologist specializing in the diagnosis of bone and soft tissue diseases and a basic scientist with an interest in the regulation of bone turnover in normal and pathologic conditions. Work in our lab has focused on the role of NF-kB signaling in the formation and activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, following our discovery >25 years ago that NF-kB positively regulates osteoclast formation. Current work focuses on the role of TRAF3/NF-kB in osteoclast precursors as a negative regulator of RANKL-induced osteoclast formation and also as a negative regulator of TGFb-induced inhibition of mesenchymal progenitor cell (MPC) differentiation into osteoblasts. Through this work, we have identified a novel subset of B cells that express RANKL and CXCR4 and found that their numbers are increased in the bone marrow (BM) of mice with TRAF3 conditionally deleted in osteoclast precursors and are the most abundant RANKL-expressing cells in BM of aging mice. We hypothesize that these cells are attracted to the BM during aging by MPCs that have increased expression of CCL12, a ligand for CXCR4, as a result of NF-kB-induced low-level chronic inflammation of aging, and cause age-related increased bone resorption. We plan to fully characterize these cells phenotypically using flow cytometry and single cell and bulk RNA-seq, map their locations in bone using a Fluidigm Hyperion CyTOF platform, and determine if: 1) they accumulate in BM of aging humans; 2) CXCR4 in B cells mediates their accumulation in the BM of aging mice by conditionally deleting CXCR4 in B cells; 3) TRAF3 expressed by MSCs regulates the accumulation of these B cells in BM by modulating SDF1 expression; 4) plerixafor (a CXCR4 inhibitor) prevents age-related osteoporosis by depleting RCBs from BM; 5) and if targeting plerixafor to bone by linking it to a bisphosphonate increases its efficacy and reduces its adverse effects.
EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE REQUIRED
The applicants must have a PhD, MD or MD/PhD degree, be highly motivated with a strong motivation to work independently with good writing and oral communication skills. Prior experience in musculoskeletal skeletal research, histomorphometry and flow cytometry is preferred, and in single cell and bulk RNA-seq would be a plus.

Description:
The Conklin Lab is seeking a Research Associate I or II, to support research projects aimed at developing CRISPR therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. Project goals include: using iPSCs and iPSC-derived neurons to test CRISPR therapies in patient-derived cells, conducting CRISPRi screens to discover factors that influence gene editing efficiency, and investigating how neuronal DNA repair affects gene editing outcomes. Ideal candidates have strong communication skills, with a preferred background in mammalian cell culture and molecular biology. Applicants interested in progressing to graduate school or medical school within 2-3 years are encouraged to apply.

About the Lab:
In the Conklin Lab, we focus on developing gene editing based therapies to treat neurodegenerative diseases. We leverage our expertise in iPSC-based cell models and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, to both model genetic diseases and test the effectiveness of gene editing therapies in patient-derived cells. Using state-of-the-art tools to deliver gene editing proteins into human neurons, we have started to identify some of the key barriers making CRISPR editing so difficult in neurons. Now, we are poised to develop cutting-edge strategies to overcome these barriers, hopefully unlocking the full potential of CRISPR editing in clinically relevant cells.
In addition to these molecular biology techniques, we are also using computational methods to optimize precise genome editing. For example, we are developing high-throughput methods to find combinations of CRISPR-Cas9 reagents that could optimally treat large and diverse patient populations. These efforts are crucial for making gene editing therapies cost-effective and accessible, to benefit as many people as possible.

POSITION
A postdoctoral position at the University of Rochester Medical Center in Dr. Brendan Boyce's Laboratory.
GENERAL SUMMARY
A postdoctoral position is available immediately in the laboratory of Dr. Boyce, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and the Center for Musculoskeletal Research at the University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, following the successful renewal of an NIH RO-1 grant that has been funded continuously since 1995. Dr. Boyce is a surgical pathologist specializing in the diagnosis of bone and soft tissue diseases and a basic scientist with an interest in the regulation of bone turnover in normal and pathologic conditions. Work in our lab has focused on the role of NF-kB signaling in the formation and activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, following our discovery >25 years ago that NF-kB positively regulates osteoclast formation. Current work focuses on the role of TRAF3/NF-kB in osteoclast precursors as a negative regulator of RANKL-induced osteoclast formation and also as a negative regulator of TGFb-induced inhibition of mesenchymal progenitor cell (MPC) differentiation into osteoblasts. Through this work, we have identified a novel subset of B cells that express RANKL and CXCR4 and found that their numbers are increased in the bone marrow (BM) of mice with TRAF3 conditionally deleted in osteoclast precursors and are the most abundant RANKL-expressing cells in BM of aging mice. We hypothesize that these cells are attracted to the BM during aging by MPCs that have increased expression of CCL12, a ligand for CXCR4, as a result of NF-kB-induced low-level chronic inflammation of aging, and cause age-related increased bone resorption. We plan to fully characterize these cells phenotypically using flow cytometry and single cell and bulk RNA-seq, map their locations in bone using a Fluidigm Hyperion CyTOF platform, and determine if: 1) they accumulate in BM of aging humans; 2) CXCR4 in B cells mediates their accumulation in the BM of aging mice by conditionally deleting CXCR4 in B cells; 3) TRAF3 expressed by MSCs regulates the accumulation of these B cells in BM by modulating SDF1 expression; 4) plerixafor (a CXCR4 inhibitor) prevents age-related osteoporosis by depleting RCBs from BM; 5) and if targeting plerixafor to bone by linking it to a bisphosphonate increases its efficacy and reduces its adverse effects.
EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE REQUIRED
The applicants must have a PhD, MD or MD/PhD degree, be highly motivated with a strong motivation to work independently with good writing and oral communication skills. Prior experience in musculoskeletal skeletal research, histomorphometry and flow cytometry is preferred, and in single cell and bulk RNA-seq would be a plus.

Full Time 40 hours Grade 055 Pathology & Lab Medicine M&D
Responsibilities
POSITION
A postdoctoral position at the University of Rochester Medical Center in Dr. Brendan Boyce's Laboratory.
GENERAL SUMMARY
A postdoctoral position is available immediately in the laboratory of Dr. Boyce, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and the Center for Musculoskeletal Research at the University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, following the successful renewal of an NIH RO-1 grant that has been funded continuously since 1995. Dr. Boyce is a surgical pathologist specializing in the diagnosis of bone and soft tissue diseases and a basic scientist with an interest in the regulation of bone turnover in normal and pathologic conditions. Work in our lab has focused on the role of NF-kB signaling in the formation and activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, following our discovery >25 years ago that NF-kB positively regulates osteoclast formation. Current work focuses on the role of TRAF3/NF-kB in osteoclast precursors as a negative regulator of RANKL-induced osteoclast formation and also as a negative regulator of TGFb-induced inhibition of mesenchymal progenitor cell (MPC) differentiation into osteoblasts. Through this work, we have identified a novel subset of B cells that express RANKL and CXCR4 and found that their numbers are increased in the bone marrow (BM) of mice with TRAF3 conditionally deleted in osteoclast precursors and are the most abundant RANKL-expressing cells in BM of aging mice. We hypothesize that these cells are attracted to the BM during aging by MPCs that have increased expression of CCL12, a ligand for CXCR4, as a result of NF-kB-induced low-level chronic inflammation of aging, and cause age-related increased bone resorption. We plan to fully characterize these cells phenotypically using flow cytometry and single cell and bulk RNA-seq, map their locations in bone using a Fluidigm Hyperion CyTOF platform, and determine if: 1) they accumulate in BM of aging humans; 2) CXCR4 in B cells mediates their accumulation in the BM of aging mice by conditionally deleting CXCR4 in B cells; 3) TRAF3 expressed by MSCs regulates the accumulation of these B cells in BM by modulating SDF1 expression; 4) plerixafor (a CXCR4 inhibitor) prevents age-related osteoporosis by depleting RCBs from BM; 5) and if targeting plerixafor to bone by linking it to a bisphosphonate increases its efficacy and reduces its adverse effects.
EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE REQUIRED
The applicants must have a PhD, MD or MD/PhD degree, be highly motivated with a strong motivation to work independently with good writing and oral communication skills. Prior experience in musculoskeletal skeletal research, histomorphometry and flow cytometry is preferred, and in single cell and bulk RNA-seq would be a plus.

POSITION SUMMARY
The Zhou lab at the Buck Institute has an opening for a Postdoctoral Researcher or Research Associate to study the connection between cellular and organismal aging, neuroscience & behavior, as well as age-related diseases (e.g., AD and ALS) using fruit flies as a model.
Cellular aging, with conserved hallmarks including proteostasis defect, mitochondrial/lysosomal dysfunction, and epigenetics changes, is well studied among different cell types. However, beyond these cellular aging phenotypes, the mechanism that leads to organismal-level aging, including cognitive function decline, gastrointestinal track malfunction, and stress vulnerability, is less understood.
The Zhou lab, which has a well-established system to study aging mechanisms at the cellular level, recently started to systematically understand how cellular aging leads to organismal aging. We adopt Drosophila as a model system to study how aging hallmarks in different cell types (e.g., neurons) contribute to organismal aging. In addition to powerful genetics in Drosophila, we leverage an array of cutting-edge techniques, encompassing advanced imaging methods, behavior screening, biochemistry, and machine learning, to assay physiological aging.
Our objective is for you to succeed and publish high-profile papers that will help you fulfill your future career goals. This is a great time to join our lab since one of several ongoing fly projects is wrapping up. Please check the Zhou lab webpage for recent publications.

Staff Scientist,University of Rochester,"Rochester, NY",$24.04 - $48.08 por hora,Full-time,"Opening
Full Time 40 hours Grade 055 Pathology & Lab Medicine M&D
Responsibilities
POSITION
A postdoctoral position at the University of Rochester Medical Center in Dr. Brendan Boyce's Laboratory.
GENERAL SUMMARY
A postdoctoral position is available immediately in the laboratory of Dr. Boyce, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and the Center for Musculoskeletal Research at the University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, following the successful renewal of an NIH RO-1 grant that has been funded continuously since 1995. Dr. Boyce is a surgical pathologist specializing in the diagnosis of bone and soft tissue diseases and a basic scientist with an interest in the regulation of bone turnover in normal and pathologic conditions. Work in our lab has focused on the role of NF-kB signaling in the formation and activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, following our discovery >25 years ago that NF-kB positively regulates osteoclast formation. Current work focuses on the role of TRAF3/NF-kB in osteoclast precursors as a negative regulator of RANKL-induced osteoclast formation and also as a negative regulator of TGFb-induced inhibition of mesenchymal progenitor cell (MPC) differentiation into osteoblasts. Through this work, we have identified a novel subset of B cells that express RANKL and CXCR4 and found that their numbers are increased in the bone marrow (BM) of mice with TRAF3 conditionally deleted in osteoclast precursors and are the most abundant RANKL-expressing cells in BM of aging mice. We hypothesize that these cells are attracted to the BM during aging by MPCs that have increased expression of CCL12, a ligand for CXCR4, as a result of NF-kB-induced low-level chronic inflammation of aging, and cause age-related increased bone resorption. We plan to fully characterize these cells phenotypically using flow cytometry and single cell and bulk RNA-seq, map their locations in bone using a Fluidigm Hyperion CyTOF platform, and determine if: 1) they accumulate in BM of aging humans; 2) CXCR4 in B cells mediates their accumulation in the BM of aging mice by conditionally deleting CXCR4 in B cells; 3) TRAF3 expressed by MSCs regulates the accumulation of these B cells in BM by modulating SDF1 expression; 4) plerixafor (a CXCR4 inhibitor) prevents age-related osteoporosis by depleting RCBs from BM; 5) and if targeting plerixafor to bone by linking it to a bisphosphonate increases its efficacy and reduces its adverse effects.
EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE REQUIRED
The applicants must have a PhD, MD or MD/PhD degree, be highly motivated with a strong motivation to work independently with good writing and oral communication skills. Prior experience in musculoskeletal skeletal research, histomorphometry and flow cytometry is preferred, and in single cell and bulk RNA-seq would be a plus.

POSITION
A postdoctoral position at the University of Rochester Medical Center in Dr. Brendan Boyce's Laboratory.
GENERAL SUMMARY
A postdoctoral position is available immediately in the laboratory of Dr. Boyce, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and the Center for Musculoskeletal Research at the University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, following the successful renewal of an NIH RO-1 grant that has been funded continuously since 1995. Dr. Boyce is a surgical pathologist specializing in the diagnosis of bone and soft tissue diseases and a basic scientist with an interest in the regulation of bone turnover in normal and pathologic conditions. Work in our lab has focused on the role of NF-kB signaling in the formation and activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, following our discovery >25 years ago that NF-kB positively regulates osteoclast formation. Current work focuses on the role of TRAF3/NF-kB in osteoclast precursors as a negative regulator of RANKL-induced osteoclast formation and also as a negative regulator of TGFb-induced inhibition of mesenchymal progenitor cell (MPC) differentiation into osteoblasts. Through this work, we have identified a novel subset of B cells that express RANKL and CXCR4 and found that their numbers are increased in the bone marrow (BM) of mice with TRAF3 conditionally deleted in osteoclast precursors and are the most abundant RANKL-expressing cells in BM of aging mice. We hypothesize that these cells are attracted to the BM during aging by MPCs that have increased expression of CCL12, a ligand for CXCR4, as a result of NF-kB-induced low-level chronic inflammation of aging, and cause age-related increased bone resorption. We plan to fully characterize these cells phenotypically using flow cytometry and single cell and bulk RNA-seq, map their locations in bone using a Fluidigm Hyperion CyTOF platform, and determine if: 1) they accumulate in BM of aging humans; 2) CXCR4 in B cells mediates their accumulation in the BM of aging mice by conditionally deleting CXCR4 in B cells; 3) TRAF3 expressed by MSCs regulates the accumulation of these B cells in BM by modulating SDF1 expression; 4) plerixafor (a CXCR4 inhibitor) prevents age-related osteoporosis by depleting RCBs from BM; 5) and if targeting plerixafor to bone by linking it to a bisphosphonate increases its efficacy and reduces its adverse effects.
EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE REQUIRED
The applicants must have a PhD, MD or MD/PhD degree, be highly motivated with a strong motivation to work independently with good writing and oral communication skills. Prior experience in musculoskeletal skeletal research, histomorphometry and flow cytometry is preferred, and in single cell and bulk RNA-seq would be a plus.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation based in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues."
