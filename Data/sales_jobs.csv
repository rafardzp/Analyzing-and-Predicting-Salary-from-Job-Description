About Us
Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.
U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.
U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington). This policy will not apply to team members hired before February 1, 2020."

Sales,Bicycle Habitat,"New York, NY",$16 - $25 por hora,Part-time,"Please take a few minutes to read what we're looking for before you apply. Once we receive your application, a manager will follow up with you if we need more information. Our busiest time is May-August, and we typically hire in late March/early April.
What we're looking for in our applicants (and a bit about Bicycle Habitat):
We have been in NYC since 1978 and have a long history of activism and support for the NYC cycling community. We are committed to making cycling safer, more fun, and more inclusive for all riders.

An incredible number of our clients are urban cyclists. Can you help them find the right bike and equipment for their cycling needs?
We are a fast-paced full-service bike shop. Can you switch gears quickly and help the dedicated mountain biker, the competitive road cyclist, and the 6 year old who is ready to ditch their training wheels? We are the busiest shop in NYC. We sell 1 of every 200 bikes Specialized sells, and 1 in every 300 bikes Trek sells in the USA. The vendors we work with make some of the greatest cycling products in the world and rely on us to provide the best service possible to our shared customers.
Applicants for all roles must be able to show up with a positive attitude and be ready to do their best every day. They must treat customers and co-workers with kindness and consideration, even when things get tough. In-season, a large part of our business happens on the weekends, so weekends are required for new hires and punctuality is non-negotiable. Full and part-time positions are available.
NYC Wage Transparency Law Disclosure: Hiring: sales and techs: $16-25/hour
We are an equal-opportunity employer. We do not discriminate based on Age, Race, Color, Religion/Creed, National Origin, Gender, Pregnancy, Gender Identity/Expression, Disability, Sexual Orientation, Marital or Partnership Status, Immigration or Citizenship Status, Arrest or Conviction Record, Credit History, Sexual and Reproductive Health Decisions, Status as a Victim of Domestic Violence, Sexual Violence, or Stalking, and Status as a Caregiver (for a child or sick family member).

Bike shop experience is not required for sales applicants. A foundation in retail/customer service is helpful, but not a must. If you have a passion for cycling, a positive attitude and enthusiasm for providing great service, we can help you fill in the rest!
You have to be ready to get creative and think on your feet, all while maintaining composure even on the busiest of summer days. Every rider's needs are unique, and every purchase, large or small, is treated with importance. You must be able to hit the ground running. There are a lot of product, sales process, and technical details to absorb, and once the season starts there's not a lot of time to learn them. We provide the tools - knowledgeable co-workers and managers, and training resources - but it's up to you to take initiative and build your knowledge.

We want our customers to love their cycling experience. Our priority is to make sure that every person who visits our stores leaves with the equipment and resources that they need to have the best time on their bikes. Our mission has not changed since we opened in 1978: More people on bikes more often. If you want to be part of a creative, high-energy team, please fill out our job application with as much information as possible, and email your resume to wheels@bicyclehabitat.com. We look forward to talking with you!"
