How You Will Be Evaluated

You will be evaluated for this job based on how well you meet the qualifications above.

Your application will be evaluated and rated under the Category Rating and Selection procedures. Based on your responses to the job-specific self-assessment questions, eligible candidates are placed for selection consideration into one of three pre-defined quality categories as described below:

Highly-qualified Category - In addition to meeting minimum qualifications for the position, candidates must fully demonstrate proficiency in all major aspects of the position.

Well Qualified Category - In addition to meeting minimum qualifications, candidates must demonstrate proficiency in some, but not all of the major aspects of the position.

Qualified Category - In addition to meeting minimum qualifications, applicants must demonstrate a basic level of knowledge, skill and ability of the position.

Application of Veterans Preference: The Category Rating Method does not add veterans' preference points or apply the ""rule of three,"" but protects the rights of veterans by placing them ahead of non-preference eligibles within each pre-defined quality category. Preference eligibles who meet minimum qualification requirements and who have a compensable service-connected disability of at least 10 percent (i.e., CPS and CP) must be listed in the highest quality category, except when the position being filled is scientific or professional at the GS-09 grade level or higher.

People & Culture Partner,State of Washington Health Benefits Exchange,"Olympia, WA","$87,699 - $114,390 por año",Full-time,"Description


The mission of Washington Health Benefit Exchange (Exchange) is to radically improve how Washington residents secure health insurance through innovative and practical solutions, an easy-to-use customer experience, our values of integrity, respect, equity and transparency, and by providing undeniable value to the health care community.

The Exchange is a public-private partnership that operates Washington Healthplanfinder, the eligibility and enrollment portal used by one in four Washington residents to obtain health and dental coverage. Through this platform, and with support from a Customer Support Center and statewide network of in-person navigators and brokers, individuals and families can shop, compare and enroll in private, qualified health plans (as defined in the Affordable Care Act) or enroll in Washington Apple Health, the state Medicaid program.

The Exchange embraces the following equity statement adopted by our Board of Directors:

Equity is fundamental to the mission of the Washington Health Benefit Exchange. The process of advancing toward equity and becoming anti-racist is disruptive and demands vigilance to dismantle deeply entrenched systems of privilege and oppression. While systemic racism is a root cause of many societal inequities, we must also use an intersectional approach to address all forms of bias and oppression, which interact with and often exacerbate racial inequities. To be successful, we must recognize the socioeconomic drivers of health and focus on people and places where needs are greatest. As we listen to community, we must hold ourselves accountable to responding to recommendations to remedy inequitable policies, systems, or practices within the Exchange’s area of influence. Our goal is that all Washingtonians have full and equal access to opportunities, power and resources to achieve their full potential.

You contribute 12.5 percent of the plan premium for coverage of you and your eligible dependents.

You may waive coverage if you are covered under another group health plan; you must provide proof. Once you waive coverage, you will only be allowed to enroll during Open Enrollment or within 60 days from the date on which your other coverage is no longer available (proof is required). If you elect to waive coverage, you will receive $300.00 per month taxable earnings, paid in two installments of $150 each on the first two paychecks of the month.

The Delta Dental PPO plan allows you to visit a dentist of your choice, change dentists at any time, go to a dental specialist of your choice, receive dental care anywhere in the world, and save on out-of-pocket expenses when you visit a PPO network dental office.

Human Resources will provide the final determination on behalf of the CEO.

EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (EAP):
SCRRA offers you and your immediate and dependent family members confidential counseling 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for family, personal, work-related and substance abuse issues through the EAP. You are entitled to a telephone session(s) with a trained EAP professional to assess the nature of the problem and provide a referral for additional assistance, if needed. Services also include three (3) face-to-face counseling sessions per family member per six (6) month period.

HEALTH ADVOCACY SERVICES:
SCRRA offers you and your eligible dependents free health advocacy services through Health Advocate. You are entitled to unlimited calls with trained professionals who can help you navigate the healthcare and insurance systems.

RETIREMENT PLAN:
The SCRRA contracts with the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS). You pay a 7.00 percent employee contribution and SCRRA pays an employer contribution, which varies each year. To be eligible for service retirement, you must be at least age 52 and have a minimum of five (5) years of CalPERS-credited service. Upon retirement you are entitled to a monthly retirement benefit based on your years of credited service, age, and average compensation during your last three (3) years of service (“final compensation”). The retirement formula for New Members is 2%@62, which means at age 62, you receive 2 percent of your final compensation for every year of service.

Upon separation from employment with less than 5 years of credited service, you may request a refund of your employee contributions only, including interest, and end your membership with CalPERS, or leave it in your account and retain your service credit should you decide to work for another CalPERS-covered agency. If you are vested upon separation but do not retire, you may leave your contributions in your account until retirement or elect a refund.

SOCIAL SECURITY:
You do not participate in Social Security except for Medicare. You will contribute 1.45 percent of your pay to cover the hospital insurance portion of Medicare.

Additional Medicare Hospital Insurance Tax: As of January 1, 2013, employees are required to pay an additional 0.9 percent Medicare tax on earnings above $200,000 (for those who file an individual return) or $250,000 (for those who file a joint return). This additional hospital insurance tax is not reflected in the rate above.

RETIREE MEDICAL:
Unrepresented employees hired before 11/1/18*: You will be eligible for medical coverage when you retire if your separation date and retirement date are within 120 days of each other. SCRRA pays the same amount for retirees as it does for active employees, which is currently 87.5 percent of the applicable premium.

Unrepresented employees hired on or after 11/1/18: You will be eligible for medical coverage when you retire if your separation date and retirement date are within 120 days of each other and you have a minimum of 10 years of credited CalPERS service, five of which must be performed at SCRRA. SCRRA pays a percentage of the state annuitant contribution rate** in accordance with the vesting schedule below:

10 Years of CalPERS Service - 50%
11 – 19 Years of CalPERS Service - 50%, plus 5% for each additional year of service
20+ Years of CalPERS Service - 100%

Once each year the employer may allow unrepresented employees hired before 11/1/18 the opportunity to individually elect to be subject to the vesting schedule.

**The state annuitant contribution rates for 2023 are: $883 (Retiree Only); $1,699 (Retiree + 1 Dependent); $2,124 (Retiree + Family).

DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN (457) :
You are eligible to set aside a portion of your current income without paying taxes on that money until it is received later during retirement when taxes may be lower. In 2023, you can defer up to 100 percent of your gross compensation or $22,500 annually, whichever is less (“normal contribution limit”). You may make an additional $7,500 contribution to the plan if you are age 50 and older. If you are at least within three years of the age in which you are eligible to receive unreduced benefits under our CalPERS retirement plan, you may contribute up to double the normal contribution limit, or $45,000.

TRANSPORTATION PASSES:
You may use your employee badge for unlimited free access to all Metrolink lines and trains. Your badge cannot be used on connecting public transportation. However, if you commute to/from work on Metrolink on a regular basis and need to connect to other public transportation (e.g., Metro Red or Purple Line) you can be issued a Metrolink pass with the appropriate station pair, which will also give you access to connecting transportation.

You are also eligible to receive a free transit pass to ride any greater Los Angeles area transit system other than Metrolink (such as, Metro, Foothill Transit, LADOT, and LOSSAN) for commuting purposes. The commuter transit pass has a value up to the monthly maximum tax-free transit pass amount established by the Internal Revenue Service ($300 in 2023). You are responsible for any transit fares above the IRS monthly cap. To receive this benefit, the SCRRA requires each employee to use public transportation to commute to and from work three (3) or more days per week.
